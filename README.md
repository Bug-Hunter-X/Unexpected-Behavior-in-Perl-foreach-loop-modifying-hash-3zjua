This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Perl related to iterating over a hash and modifying it concurrently. The `bug.pl` file shows the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version.  The issue arises from the re-indexing of hash keys when elements are deleted during iteration using a `foreach` loop. The solution involves using a copy of keys to ensure consistent iteration.
